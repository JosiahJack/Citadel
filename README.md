# Citadel

### News
We are in Beta now!  There a have already been quite a few bugs reported with
this public release but here it is: https://github.com/JosiahJack/Citadel/releases/tag/v0.99

- Sincerely, Josiah 3/12/2022

### Information
Version 0.99, as of 12/25/2022
Started 7/6/2015
Released TBD (currently in alpha, no recent builds)
The System Shock Fan Remake. Â The goal is to recreate the original closely while enhancing it with 3D models instead of 2D sprites, 3D details to the station in and out, particle effects, and subtle sound effect additions. Â After releasing a playable version, focus will shift to making mod and mapping tools.

PLEASE submit bug and feature requests here on this github.

If you would like to join and aid in any capacity, please email Josiah Jack, the main author, at josiahjackcitadel@gmail.com

Special thanks to Looking Glass Studios and Origin Games for the original 1994 product. 
Special thanks to Night Dive Studios for allowing this project to live on (unhindered).


Install Instructions:
DISCLAIMER: Citadel is in-progress. That means features may be broken, missing, or not in a final state of polish. Also, this means that the game is not in an "installable" state and must be "built" in Unity OR ran inside the Unity editor. Also, the github version is always updated after I get to a reasonable "stopping point" for adding to the game. This means Github is missing certain features that are actually closed in the Issues list on here (I'll change this at some point where I don't close bugs for instance until after the commit is done for that bug.) Continue for your own fun.

1. Download the Github repository (or clone it via git).
2. Install UnityVersion2019.4.35f1 Personal: https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download/archive
3. Extract all into a folder and name of your liking.
4. Open Unity.
5. Click on Open Other or Open Project (the name if the button changes depending on whether it is a fresh install or already installed.)
6. Select the top folder where you extracted the game files. It must be only one level above the Assets folder, e.g. Citadel-v0.1/Assets.
7. Wait as Unity loads in the project and reimports all assets and auto-compiles the script code (may take an hour for the very first time).
8. Either A. Click the play button at the top of the screen (it's a triangle), or B. In the top menu bar go to File->Build & Run.
