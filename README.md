# Citadel

### News
Lately working through some major bugfixing efforts.  I've developed several scripts to automate iterating over all 156000 objects in the game and have fixed numerous small oversights and setup errors for various objects; this small initial effort has saved tremendous "manual" bug hunting time.  Getting very close to a sufficient quality level to release another round of test builds.  Appreciate the patience for those who have kept an eye on this project for so long.

### Information
Version 0.97, as of 2/21/2022
Started 7/6/2015
Released TBD
The System Shock Fan Remake. Â The goal is to recreate the original closely while enhancing it with 3D models instead of 2D sprites, 3D details to the station in and out, particle effects, and subtle sound effect additions. Â After releasing a playable version, focus will shift to making mod and mapping tools.

PLEASE submit bug and feature requests here on this github.

Install Instructions:
DISCLAIMER: Citadel is in-progress. That means features may be broken, missing, or not in a final state of polish. Also, this means that the game is not in an "installable" state and must be "built" in Unity OR ran inside the Unity editor. Also, the github version is always updated after I get to a reasonable "stopping point" for adding to the game. This means Github is missing certain features that are actually closed in the Issues list on here (I'll change this at some point where I don't close bugs for instance until after the commit is done for that bug.) Continue for your own fun.

1. Download the Github repository.
2. Install UnityVersion2019.3.6f1.personal: https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download/archive
3. Extract all into a folder and name of your liking.
4. Open Unity.
5. Click on Open Other or Open Project (the name if the button changes depending on whether it is a fresh install or already installed.)
6. Select the top folder where you extracted the game files. It must be only one level above the Assets folder, e.g. Citadel-v0.1/Assets.
7. Wait as Unity loads in the project and reimports all assets and auto-compiles the script code (may take an hour for the very first time).
8. Either A. Click the play button at the top of the screen (it's a triangle), or B. In the top menu bar go to File->Build & Run.
