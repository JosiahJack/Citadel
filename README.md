# Citadel
Started 7/6/2015
Released -ETA 9/22/18-
The fan System Shock remake. Â The goal is to recreate the original closely while enhancing it with 3D models instead of 2D sprites, 3D details to the station in and out, particle effects, and subtle sound effect additions. Â After releasing a playable version, focus will shift to making mod and mapping tools.

PLEASE submit bug and feature requests here on this github.

Special thanks to Looking Glass Studios and Origin Games for the original 1994 product. 
Special thanks to Night Dive Studios for allowing this project to live on unhindered.


DISCLAIMER: Citadel is work in progress. That means features may be broken, missing, or not in a final state of polish. Also, this means that the game is not in an "installable" state and must be "built" in Unity OR ran inside the Unity editor. Also, the github version is always updated after I get to a reasonable "stopping point" for adding to the game. This means Github is missing certain features that are actually closed in the Issues list on here (I'll change this at some point where I don't close bugs for instance until after the commit is done for that bug.) Continue for your own fun.

Install Instructions:

1. Download the Github repository.
2. Install Unity 2019.1.0.0f2: https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download/archive
3. Extract all into a folder and name of your liking.
4. Open Unity.
5. Click on Open Other or Open Project (the name if the button changes depending on whether it is a fresh install or already installed.)
6. Select the top folder where you extracted the game files. It must be only one level above the Assets folder, e.g. Citadel-v0.1/Assets.
7. Wait as Unity loads in the project and reimports all assets and auto-compiles the script code (may take an hour for the very first time).
8. Either A. Click the play button at the top of the screen (it's a triangle), or B. In the top menu bar go to File->Build & Run.
