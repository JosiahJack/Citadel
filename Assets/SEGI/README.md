You can also click the "Clone or Download" button and select "Download Zip", then extract the contents to "Assets/SEGI" in your project to test out the latest unreleased versions of SEGI.

All the scripts and files for SEGI must be in "Assets/SEGI" for SEGI to fully function properly in your project.
