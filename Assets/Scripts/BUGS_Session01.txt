  - Earthshaker on level R opposite trap room
  - Flechette on level R near 2 cyborg assassins with grav lift
  - Logic probe on level R to left of the elevator

// Low Priority / Visual
- Legacy keybinds needs to respect hardware hotkeys.
- Search FX not positioned to mouse
- Search FX only goes to left MFD even if search is currently on the right.

Using the Unity URP sample scene (construction site). FORWARD RENDERER
Remove Reflection Probes
Remove Light Probes
Remove Vignette (0.01ms cost)

Light Baking:
Baked Indirect is slow, increases draw calls to 85, FPS 69.9, 14.3ms
Subtractive is faster, reduces draw calls to 74, FPS 72, 13.9ms
Shadowmask is slowest, increases draw calls to 85, FPS 68.3, 14.7ms
Realtime is fastest, draw calls at 77, FPS 72.8, 13.7ms

Scene Settings:
Removing Environment Lighting skybox ambient lighting has no affect.
Removing Environment Reflections, draw calls at 77, FPS 73.2FPS, 13.6ms
Remove Directional Light, draw calls 53, FPS 80.5, 12.5ms
Remove scene Other Settings Fog, draw calls 53, FPS 83.1, 12.0ms

Re-add Reflection Probes, draw calls 61, FPS 78.2, 12.8ms (Needed subtractive bake)
Removed Reflection Probes again.
Re-add Light Probes, draw calls 61, FPS 82.0, 12.2ms
Removed Light Probes again. (removed baking)
Remove Bloom, draw calls 34, FPS 84.9, 11.8ms
Remove Tonemapping, draw calls 34, FPS 90.0, 11.1ms

Lighting:

Lights that affect all objects (or very nearly):
1 Spotlight, draw calls 34, FPS 90.0, 11.1ms
2 Spotlights, draw calls 50, FPS 78.3, 12.8ms
3 Spotlights, draw calls 66, FPS 63.8, 15.6ms
4 Spotlights, draw calls 77, FPS 58.0, 17.2ms
5 Spotlights, draw calls 92, FPS 56.8, 17.6ms
6 Spotlights, draw calls 108, FPS 56.0, 17.9ms
7 Spotlights, draw calls 119, FPS 55.8, 18.0ms
8 Spotlights, draw calls 135, FPS 54.8, 18.3ms
Huge cost with 4, plateaus somewhat after.
Remove all back down to 1 Spotlight.
Removed all spotlights.
Add 1 Pointlight, draw calls 57, FPS 95.2, 10.6ms
2 Point, draw calls 99, FPS 77.2, 13.0ms
3 Point, draw calls 143, FPS 66.3, 15.2ms
4 Point, draw calls 177, FPS 57.9, 17.3ms
5 Point, draw calls 223, FPS 56.3, 17.9ms
6 Point, draw calls 214, FPS 59.4, 16.9ms (Engine confusion on which is important)
I recall that there is a limit of 4 lights per object so
additional lights here don't do much.
Remove all point lights and spotlights were already gone.

Lights that affect at most 4 objects (as best as I can tell):
Add 1 Spotlight, draw calls 27, FPS 100.6, 9.9ms
2 Spotlights, draw calls 37, FPS 94.8, 10.6ms
3 Spotlights, draw calls 36, FPS 86.6, 11.6ms
4 Spotlights, draw calls 39, FPS 80.0, 12.5ms
5 Spotlights, draw calls 48, FPS 79.9, 12.4ms
6 Spotlights, draw calls 52, FPS 78.4, 12.8ms
7 Spotlights, draw calls 56, FPS 76.7, 13.0ms
8 Spotlights, draw calls 62, FPS 74.4, 13.3ms
Removed all spotlights.
Add 1 Pointlight, draw calls 48, FPS 106.4, 9.4ms (BEST YET!)
2 Point, draw calls 81, FPS 89.2, 11.2ms
3 Point, draw calls 97, FPS 82.2, 12.2ms
4 Point, draw calls 113, FPS 75.2, 13.3ms
5 Point, draw calls 143, FPS 72.6, 13.7ms
6 Point, draw calls 138, FPS 75.4, 13.3ms
7 Point, draw calls 160, FPS 70.3, 14.3ms
8 Point, draw calls 173, FPS 68.3, 14.6ms
Removed all point lights and spotlights.

Chuck Light, chuck a whole bunch at it
60 Spotlights, draw calls 523, FPS 43.5, 23.0ms
