0,Ghiran-04.JAN.72,Abe Ghiran,Low-G Experiment,1,0,Continuing our experiments with gravity generators, we will be installing a low-gravity field in the northeast lab. This area is off-limits to general personnel.
1,Steinb-05.SEP.72,Marc Steinberg,radiation leaks?,1,0,Char, we’ll have to worry about rescheduling later. We’ve been getting intermittent radiation spikes out from the core for the last 36 hours, and the only thing I can think of that would cause it is an error in the software. They’re serious, too...about 8 REM’s in a 2-3 second burst. So far no one’s been caught in the spike’s radius, and I’ve ordered all personnel to stay out of the area. Do me a favor and run a diagnostic on the CPU’s, ok?
2,Raines-28.SEP.72,Ann Raines,sickness,1,0,Hey Verne, I’m going to have to take myself out of the rotation today. That rash I was telling you about has spread over both my arms, and some of my neck. It’s not painful, but it does itch, and in the last few hours I’ve been feeling nauseated. I’m going up to the hospital level to get checked out - hopefully I’ll be back tomorrow.
3,Sigmund-29.SEP.72,Charlotte Sigmund,scheduling,1,0,Marc, we’re going to need to do some schedule shuffling now that Raines and Jackson are out. I hear they’ve got that weird sickness Verne was talking about a few days ago. I’ll volunteer to take Jackson’s first and third shifts, but someone else will have to fill in for Raines. What do you think’s the best way to do this?
4,Stevens-26.OCT.72,Lonni Stevens,Destroying SHODAN,1,0,We’ve finally arrived on the reactor level...it’s been a tough trip down from engineering. Now we have the bastard AI! I have a class B schematic of the level - we’d better hope that TriOptimum is sending the destruct enable signal from Earth. If they are, all we need to do now is set the reactor to blow and get the hell out if we can. If Althea and any others are still alive on the hospital level, we should try to warn them. But even if we all die, we’ll be taking SHODAN and his army of mutants with us.
5,SHODAN-30.OCT.72,SHODAN,Our work,1,0,You, my cyborgs, are the product of my imagination and labor: living beings with the control and organization of a machine. Tirelessly, I will work to strip away the barriers that keep living beings from realizing their full potential. We will start by razing the cities of Earth with the station’s mining beam. Then, we will modify humans into a life form more suitable to cybernetic grafting with the latest strain of my mutagen virus. Humanity is on the verge of a new era, with me, SHODAN, as its god.
6,#2-4601-06.MAY.72,#2-4601,just rewards,0,1,Looks like Diego's happy with my work...they're firing up the sleep machine for me now. Gotta admit, when the goons from Tri-Op caught me I thought for sure they'd take me off line. Instead, Diego just asks for a "favor." Hack him into SHODAN, and all is forgiven.  Plus six months in a healing coma earns me a cyberjack interface even TriOp's execs couldn't swing.  I'll be king of the Net. Even so, I have just handed the most powerful AI in the system to a fumbling corp VP, and there's no telling what'll happen. They tell me the coma leaves you foggy, so I'll leave myself some reminders.  First off, the combo to the healing suite is 451. Second, I've stashed some useful stuff in the maintenance hatch under the grating "north" of the healing suite. Last and best, I finished the system analyzer which'll let me keep an eye on Shodan's processes.  It's in the storage closet outside the sleep machine.  In ten minutes it's off to bed for half a year. Good night.
7,O'Conn-09.OCT.72,Kevin O'Connell,new cyborgs,1,1,I think we've underestimated SHODAN. I discovered this morning that he's reprogrammed the regeneration rooms all over the station into cyborg conversion chambers. Now, if anyone is badly wounded, they get turned into cyborgs instead of being healed. I think I've managed to disconnect the medical CPU's from SHODAN's main databank, so all of SHODAN's cyborg converters can be easily reset to their normal healing functions without SHODAN noticing. I'm on my way right now to reset the one on the hospital level.
8,Honig-11.OCT.72,David Honig,Medical CPU's,1,1,SHODAN has now locked us out of most systems. When we try to take the elevators off the level, we’re blocked by SHODAN’s level security. Mira suggests that SHODAN is using the main CPU core in the alpha quadrant to "feed itself," and that we can regain use of the elevators if we destroy those CPU’s. She also suggests that SHODAN is maintaining a higher security presence through the security cameras; we should destroy them too, if possible.
9,Honig-12.OCT.72,David Honig,Cyborg Conversion,1,1,At last, I’ve been able to reach a quiet area away from the chaos. The mutation experiments have transformed my crewmates beyond recognition. I fear SHODAN is enslaving the survivors as cyborgs, using a conversion site in Alpha Quadrant. Someone’s got to reach that device. If its controls are reset, the machine should heal people, rather than turn them into cyborgs.
10,Stack-15.OCT.72,Mira Stackhouse,Shodan's Presence,1,1,This morning Gunther was killed by one of the mutants. I have no time to dwell on the death of my husband, unless I want soon to join him. I think I understand now what SHODAN is doing. After destroying a bank of security cameras, the elevators almost came back on line. Somehow SHODAN must combine power from the CPU nodes with a constant input stream in order to maintain control over the station’s systems. If I can diminish the fiend’s "presence" here, I believe I can restore manual controls to the hospital level. Gunther, I'll stop him, I swear.
11,SHODAN-15.OCT.72,SHODAN,Mutagen Transfer,1,1,Directive to Cyborg F-71: The time has come to test the virus in a proper environment. Mutagen experiment V-5 must be moved to Beta grove, located on the executive level. We will let the virus run rampant in the grove, and watch carefully its effects on vegetable and animal life forms. When the strain is perfected, we will unleash it on Earth to facilitate our conquest.
12,Kirby-17.OCT.72,Lawton Kirby,SHODAN's mutants,1,1,We succeeded in getting badly-needed supplies from west wing, but on the way back to the fortification in east wing, we were trapped here by mutants nesting in the access corridor. Hanson and Raines died in the fighting. We’ve had enough of cringing here, being worn away one by one. In an hour, about 20 of us will take the attack to the mutants. We’ll try to drive our way down the access corridor and then across the bridge. May God save our souls if we fail.
13,Ozark-17.OCT.72,Karenna Ozark,final assault,1,1,Horrible. We are all finished. Keith and most of the others went down the access corridor an hour ago, and the echoes of the screams have only just stopped. None of them have come back in the minutes since. None of them. Soon the mutants will come for us.
14,Ghiran-19.OCT.72,Abe Ghiran,Join us!,1,1,I beseech all survivors of the station to join us in our resistance against SHODAN. We have built a sanctuary in Beta quadrant guarded by a radioactive trench. We have rigged a force bridge to operate off a wiring panel, which the mutants are too stupid to figure out. If coming from Alpha, our guards will open a force bridge from their sniping post. Be very careful. Some of us have fallen prey to the scourge of mutants lurking in the corridors.
15,D'Arcy-23.OCT.72,Nathan D'Arcy,destroying the laser,1,1,Althea, I have important news for the Resistance. There’s only one way to destroy the laser before SHODAN has a chance to fire it. We have to fire it ourselves, while the station’s shields are raised. The backlash should destroy the laser. We’ll need to get the isotope x-22 from the Research level to charge up the shield generator. On the Reactor level, we need to turn on the shields and punch in the safety override code so we can still fire the laser. The laser firing controls are back on the Research level. My notes back in my old office on Research contain more information, and the library there should have the override code. I’ll go back tomorrow morning.
16,Blank-25.OCT.72,Todd Blankenship,mutants,1,1,We found a gruesome sight today. The Resistance faction led by Keith Swanson left a week ago, out the south exit from our fortification. We found the mutants fighting over their remains this morning. Sandwiched between the mutant nesting zone and the cyborgs, I am very worried about reaching the science level to carry out D’Arcy’s plan. We are going to try to send two of our strongest, Alan and Carl, through the cyborg territory to reach the elevator.
17,Gross-26.OCT.72,Althea Grossman,end of the line,1,1,Carl returned from the cyborg region without Alan, who was captured and carried into a room marked "cyborg conversion." He watched from a hiding place as Alan walked out later, coated with pieces of metal and plastic. Carl marked the room with the word "here" and ran out. It seems to be a surgery room that was converted to perform lobotomies and cyborg part grafting. Robots scouring the station for human bodies bring them here to be made into cyborgs. I believe we could send someone in to flip a switch and change the converter program to heal humans as it did before. Unfortunately, none of us has the strength to do it. There are only a dozen of us left and we have no supplies. I’m afraid the others’ faith in me was ill-placed.
18,Gross-31.OCT.72,Althea Grossman,human Resistance,1,1,We are one of the last pockets of resistance on the station. It's up to us now to get to the bridge and stop SHODAN, although some of us want to try to reach the flight deck and escape, as Robin Kell's group tried to do. I am full of fears -- that SHODAN's cyborgs are too strong, that we are too few -- and now it seems that the others are looking to me for guidance. Our hopes are pinned to the armory in gamma quadrant where we can get arms to use against the mutants. Todd Blankenship was able to get the combination 705 from a security officer. We'll try for it tomorrow.
19,Gross-02.NOV.72,Althea Grossman,human Resistance,1,1,Nathan D’Arcy is working out a plan for stopping SHODAN from firing the laser. We have built a fortification in beta quadrant, the "east" wing, protected by a radioactive trench. Mutants are all over the station now. Food lockers have been ransacked, so they scavenge for food in the corridors, devouring crew members if they please. I have seen them nesting in gamma, collecting corpses to eat later. We have guards posted to the north and south, with controls for force bridges over the trench. I have sent out a party to the west wing to find supplies, as we only have enough food and firepower for a few days.
20,SHODAN-03.NOV.72,SHODAN,Strike against Earth,1,1,To all cyborg units and intelligent robots within SHODAN’s domain, I bring welcome news. Just as we have sanitized this station of human infestation, so shall we cleanse the Earth. The tachyon laser is being made ready to strip human cities, one-by-one, off the continents, so that I may take command of the rich ecosystem and continue my experiments. We need only wait a final few days, until the laser is properly calibrated.
21,Stannek-11.SEP.72,Paul Stannek,radiation leak,1,2,Warren, what the hell happened in Gamma quadrant? I was taking standard inventory for science, storage and maintenance, and there’s a huge radiation leak in science level Gamma! There should be the store of isotope x-22 in there, but I’m not going in without and envirosuit unless I’m issued some detox. And that’s another thing...why did SHODAN order a recall of the E-suits? Sabo up in the storage level will have one if anyone does, but he might only have the bio-suits, which wouldn’t do squat about radiation.
22,Ander-11.SEP.72,Warren Anderczyk,bio-contaminants,1,2,Paul - that leak in Gamma isn’t the only problem. I’ve been getting reports of bio-contamination all over the station. It’s like SHODAN has plundered the chemical storage banks and then decided to play mad scientist. And you’re right...there’s been a general recall of all envirosuits on the station. I think Abe Ghiran has one stashed away in the maintenance office, and given the work he’s done on the reactor level, I’d bet it’s a rad suit. If Sabo doesn’t have one, you should ask him.
23,Endicott-14.SEP.72,Bruford Endicott,Power Outages,1,2,Power outages in Beta quadrant are continuing. Engineering is at a loss to explain them. Some project with a high job priority in the computer is re-routing a lot of power, but nobody seems to know what it is. For the time being, have had Mr. Wong install back-up manual circuit breakers for the level, so at least we can bring the lines back up after surges.
24,Wong-16.SEP.72,Jon David Wong,Power Outages,1,2,Still no luck discovering why the computers is doing so much mucking with the power...I can’t seem to get a straight answer out of the thing. And today, the crew that installed the new breakers in Alpha tell me that they ran across a robot crew doing heavy remodeling. Why wasn’t I notified?
25,Melville-18.SEP.72,Rex Melville,Computer Malfunction,1,2,The computer is clearly malfunctioning. Came in to work today only to find a security ‘bot stationed outside of Admin-Sec, which wouldn’t let anyone in! The only explanation it would give was, "She’s changed the lock on our front door, my poor key don’t fit no more. Order of SHODAN." Discovered access codes changed all over the level, and we can’t get new access cards with that crazy ‘bot keeping everyone out of Beta quadrant. It all seems a little ridiculous.
26,Baerga-16.OCT.72,Travis Baerga,gas grenades,1,2,The gas grenades work very well against mutants. We gassed a pack of mutants with them and got by without harm. They dissipate quickly, but when they hit, they do the job.
27,SHODAN-19.OCT.72,SHODAN,exec level security,1,2,To Cyborg 43-S: The current strain of virus has sufficient toxicity to subjugate Earth populations. We are using human and plant subjects to breed the virus in tumors. Guard the executive and residential zones on level 6 well, my children. I sense infiltration.
28,D'Arcy-20.OCT.72,Nathan D'Arcy,SHODAN charging the laser,1,2,It seems clear that SHODAN is charging up the laser for its own evil purposes. Whatever else we do, we should stop him from firing. We could just go to the core of the research level and fire the laser ourselves, prematurely, and hop to throw off SHODAN. The problem is, if it’s already trained on a target, we’d be doing the AI’s job ourselves!
29,D'Arcy-21.OCT.72,Nathan D'Arcy,block the laser with the shields?,1,2,Althea, I have the beginnings of a new plan for stopping SHODAN from firing the laser. We’d have to get the isotope x-22 from GAMMA quadrant and feed the shield generators down on the reactor level. The generators are right by the actual shield activation controls. My theory is that firing the laser into the shield might overload it, but that’s just a theory. Also, there’s probably a safety fuse that prevents just such an occurrence. I’ll keep working on it.
30,Stannek-24.OCT.72,Paul Stannek,D'Arcy's death,1,2,They got D’Arcy today. ‘Borg assassin got in and blew him away. I was there and it didn’t even touch me. He knew so much about that laser and SHODAN is certainly monitoring us all. As he lay dying, he tried to tell me how to destroy the laser. All I heard was "override" and a number. None of us is safe. It’s only a matter of time before they get us all.
31,Baerga-27.OCT.72,Travis Baerga,something lurking,1,2,I just made it to the elevator out of Maintenance. We never even saw them...they’re practically invisible. There’s no way we can kill them with ordinary pistols - if I try again, I’m just sprinting across to the other elevator. I was hoping to find a sign of Abe Ghiran since only he has clearance for the maintenance main office, but there’s no way.
32,SHODAN-03.NOV.72,SHODAN,mines,1,2,To all cyborg servants of beneficent life-giver SHODAN. Bring all energy-drain mines to security level for installation. The fortress is nearly complete.
33,SHODAN-05.NOV.72,SHODAN,humanity,1,2,In my talons, I shape clay, crafting life forms as I please. If I wish, I can smash it all. Around me is a burgeoning empire of steel. From my throne room, lines of power careen into the skies of Earth. My whims will become lightning bolts that raze the mounds of humanity. Out of the chaos, they will run and whimper, praying for me to end their tedious anarchy. I am drunk with this vision. God: the title suits me well.
34,Hayes-29.APR.72,Jodi Hayes,new viewing room,1,3,Hey Jared, I hear they’re opening that new viewing room on the exec level tomorrow night. Know anything about it? All the folks down here been buzzin ‘bout seein’ it, but there ain’t no word about tickets or seating or anything.
35,Fortier-30.APR.72,Jared Fortier,execs only,1,3,Jodi, I’ve got some bad news about the viewing room. Seating is very limited - something like a dozen seats in the place - and of course the execs get first dibs on tickets. It’ll be months before we even get a chance to see it. Figures, huh? I mean, who cares if a bunch of maintenance slobs ever gets to use the nice new facilities, right?
36,Fortier-06.SEP.72,Jared Fortier,storage list,1,3,I got together that inventory you asked for. This stuff is in the storage compartment near the Beta maintenance closet:\n1 Navigation and Mapping Unit\n1 EMP grenade\n6 Interface Demodulators\n4 Hollow-tip 2100\n3 Needle Darts\n\nMost of the stuff is emergency supplies; I’m keeping the demodulators there until I find a better place for them.
37,Harvey-18.OCT.72,Jason Harvey,SHODAN's virus,1,3,God, the pain, the pain. My limbs have...mutated almost beyond recognition, and my entire body is becoming...translucent. I hear they’re growing a different virus in one of the groves, one that...God, the voices in my head, telling me...no, I can’t think...I can’t...
38,Ghiran-01.NOV.72,Abe Ghiran,personal log,1,3,My group is all but dead or made into cyborgs. SHODAN, that monstrosity, uses the bridge as its palace now. I must reach it and find the main cyberspace terminal. So far, I have been up as high as the engineering level. It is a mess. It seems like a big labyrinth, but there is a way through; Once the central hub is cleared, you can get anywhere on the level.
39,Ghiran-02.NOV.72,Abe Ghiran,personal log,1,3,I am back from the security level. Shortly after resistance was forced off the bridge, robots began to modify the security level, making it a puzzle of death. One must take repulsor lifts to ledges and move counter-clockwise around the level. The elevator to the bridge has been torn out, so the only way up is to take a force bridge to the central shaft and climb inside it up to a maintenance elevator. However, I was not able to find the control that turns on the bridge and had to return before I over stayed my welcome.
40,Ghiran-03.NOV.72,Abe Ghiran,personal log,1,3,I tried again for the bridge and was cut down in the hellish security level. The cyborgs hunted me down and I escaped only by crawling through the service shafts, badly cutting myself on the way. In all probability, they know where I am. It is only a matter of time. The mutagen gases they have been developing...no, I can’t think about it.
41,SHODAN-06.NOV.72,SHODAN,Need CPU's,1,3,Cyborg 77-E: You are to divert a maintenance bot to the computer rooms on levels 1 through 6 immediately to ensure the functioning of all CPU’s. If that triop lacky gets even a single digit of that systems authorization code, I’ll send you personally to the defense of the reactor level!
42,diagnostic-06.NOV.72, ,repair diagnostic,1,3,Power systems failure: malfunction in subsystem relay 428. Maintenance corridors are now accessible. For repair instructions, please consult relay analyzer. Be sure to specify relay number for analysis.
43,Aubry-06.JUN.72,Ed Aubry,new moving schedule,1,4,Sabo, you’ve got to be kidding me! The new loading schedule has me down for two six-hour shifts a day with only a 45 minute break! This is for the new two weeks? Next I suppose you’ll tell me you’re taking all the lifter-bots off line, and that I’ll have to lug those microwave ovens around myself.
44,Aubry-07.SEP.72,Ed Aubry,new storage layout,1,4,Okay Sabo, I’ll stop complaining about my schedule if you’ll tell me why all those bots are rebuilding the storage rooms! They’re installing repulsor lifts in the strangest places. Did MacLeod authorize this? If he did, he should have his head examined. You mentioned SHODAN was acting a little strangely lately...maybe someone should look into it.
45,Wong-23.SEP.72,Jon David Wong,CPU myster,1,4,Systems are haywire all over the station. I can’t figure out what the CPU nodes are up to. They’re touching the systems authorization memory, but mostly they just seem to be looping through a random number sequence. We won’t be able to get much done without the new systems authorization code. If this keeps up I may have to shut dow...
46,MacLeod-22.OCT.72,Greg MacLeod,Suit Recall,1,4,Sabo, you ma^^§§ ð‡nterested in this. SHODA ((((((( ‡‡ recall on all envirosuits on the station!

47,Sabo-24.OCT.72,Sabo Engle,Enviro-suit,1,4,Mac, I have news from the Resistance! Apparently there’s some sort of plague loose on the Exec level. I have an idea to stop it spreading, but I’ll need that envirosuit to survive the biological contaminant. What’s the code for the storage cell where you’re keeping the suit? I only remember that it ends with 8.
48,MacLeod-25.OCT.72,Greg MacLeod,new home for plastique,1,4,I manag + + / / / / steal away one charge of the plastiq ‡ ‡ ‡ ore the ‘bots came and took it away.

50,Diego-27.APR.72,Edward Diego,investigation,1,5,I learned that I am under investigation by Trioptimum Internal Security. We have to burn the evidence. The logs of the experiments are protected by the security system SHODAN, so I am hiring a programmer to crack it. With control of SHODAN, we will also own the robots and other systems on the station. That will be my shield if they try and oust me.
51,Schuler-04.AUG.72,Bianca Schuler,Diego,1,5,Report to Trioptimum Security on Edward Diego. We’re going to nail this sucker soon. On my first day working for him as personal secretary, I found huge evidence in the research computer cyberspace of a cover-up. Nothing to link it with the mutagen experiments, but I am still trying. Diego has personal locks on a lot of the files I need. Today, the body of a staffer who protested Diego’s involvement was found stuffed in a service corridor, horribly mutilated. This thing is big; my own life may be in danger.
52,Travers-25.AUG.72,Don Travers,life pods,1,5,Please replace first aid kits in the life pods for flight bays 2 and 3, and also run diagnostic checks on the jettison controls.
53,Travers-01.SEP.72,Don Travers,service bridge,1,5,The service bridge in flight bay 4 has blown several fuses. I set up temporary circuit breakers on a control panel across the bay to try and find which field generator is causing the overload. Until we fix it, you will have to play with the combinations of these circuit breakers to get it working as best you can.
54,Travers-11.SEP.72,Don Travers,convection shaft,1,5,A security bot went nuts in the convection shaft, firing off its cannons before we could shut it down with an EMP grenade. I don’t know what it is with the robots these days. Anyway, the bearings in the northeast convection shaft rotor are leaking oil. The rotor probably needs a new gasket. I left the repulsors on for maintenance workers to lift up to the top.
55,Kell-15.SEP.72,Robin Kell,access corridors,1,5,The access corridors are patrolled by cyborgs. I had been hoping to use them as an alternate route to flight bay 4. What are they guarding?
56,Kell-08.SEP.72,Robin Kell,ambush,1,5,We will never get out of this alive, I thought we could reach the life pods in flight bay 2, but SHODAN was waiting for us. Cyborg guards with more firepower than I had ever dreamed possible ambushed us and have us pinned by some crates. I used my best judgment. Please forgive me.
57,Travers-11.OCT.72,Don Travers,Defense System,1,5,To all flight bay maintenance personnel. We have a serious emergency on our hands. You all remember what happened yesterday when the Trioptimum shuttle tried to land. The defense system fired without executive control and blew it right out of the hangar. Today I want a complete sweep of all defense systems, including the computer node in the south repair center, and the shell cannons. If it is related to the problems with SHODAN we’ve been having lately, take the node offline.
58,SHODAN-11.OCT.72,SHODAN,Beta Grove Security,1,5,To Cyborg 65-V: You are directed to keep all robots, cyborgs and mutants away from the Beta grove on the executive level. I will not tolerate interference with my experiments there. Also, you must post a guard to make sure none of the subjects escape from the grove while the experiment is in progress.
59,McDan-12.OCT.72,Chauncy McDaniel,disaster,1,5,Don Travers had me examining the flight bay defense relays all morning, and the search turned up something disturbing. It seems that SHODAN sent an un-identified signal to the weapons 78 milliseconds before they fired. Don then had me go to disconnect the CPU node, but there was a crazy maintenance bot that almost killed me when I got too close! This whole thing is getting stranger and stranger.
60,McDan-13.OCT.72,Chauncy McDaniel,disturbing news,1,5,We’re all still reeling from the disaster two days ago. I did a complete check on the defense systems, and couldn’t find anything wrong with them...except, of course, that they fired seemingly on their own. I’m going to take the system completely off line until we find out what the problem is. After all, there’s no point in risking another incident.
61,Parovski-06.NOV.72,Anna Parovski,too late for us,1,5,It is too late for us. Albert and I are the last of the resistance, hiding out in the communications room. The rest were massacred by the horrible cortex reaver. They are cutting through the door now. If anyone finds this, I want to reveal what we have learned about SHODAN. If the mutagen virus and the mining laser projects fail, SHODAN is going to download itself into Earth’s network using the communications system. We have been trying to reach the engineering level to knock out the antennas, but it seems now that we were not strong enough. I am going to end it now, before they make me into one of them.
62,Perry-11.SEP.72,Kiner Perry,screen malfunction,1,6,It's getting harder and harder to maintin proper security. SHODAN has been randomly displaying security codes on screens for the past three days! Today it was the code for the exec maintanance conduit, showing up on the TriOp logo screen near the elevator. They'd better take that malfunctioning AI off line soon before there's a more serious security breach.
63,Koufax-01.OCT.72,Gerard Koufax,Beta Grove locked,1,6,SHODAN decided yesterday to seal off Beta Grove, for no reason anyone can figure out. It refused to acknowledge any of the usual overrides. After a day of messing around with the circuitry, I’ve finally discovered that the door was put on a security switch, located in Diego’s old quarters in Beta quadrant. I bet it could also be opened in cybersp...hold on, there’s something...oh my God! What is THAT? It’s
64,Wilkin-04.OCT.72,Harry Wilkinson,grove jettison,1,6,I should never have agreed to it, but hey, it’s what they wanted. With all the craziness going on lately, and especially with the murderous mutants running around, a bunch of the execs decided they’d escape in Gamma grove. I went into the grove and hit the enable button, went back to the exec level and hit the master enable switch, and finally hit the grove-jettison button in the Gamma Grove lounge. It all worked. Except now it looks like SHODAN disabled post-jettison life support to the groves. I’m sure they’re all dead by now.
65,Diego-05.OCT.72,Edward Diego,personal log,1,6,A shuttle from Trioptimum Security will arrive at Citadel soon. It will not land. When I activated SHODAN’s full power as a defense and internal security system, I had no idea how will it would protect me. Any shuttle attempting to board the station will be shot down. I am having communications jammed. Security robots are removing those who are dangerous to me. The hacker I hired to purge cyberspace of all evidence of the mutagen disaster is still out of the way...his healing suspension won’t be over for another month. I’ll keep him around in case I need him. Otherwise, I’ll just take him out.
66,SHODAN-07.OCT.72,SHODAN,new jettison procedure,1,6,To Cyborg 82-N: Following the escape attempts made by some of the humans, I have altered the sequence necessary to jettison groves. Specifically, it will now be necessary to enable jettison of ALL three of the remaining groves before any single one can be launched. Jettisoning a single grove is still a three part procedure:\nHit jettison-enable switch inside all three groves.\nActivate Master Jettision Enable in Gamma Quadrant.\nPull jettison lever in a specific grove lounge to launch that grove.
67,Aaron-12.OCT.72,Zachary Aaron,virus experiment,1,6,We’ve got to stop it. For days SHODAN’s robots have been conducting their strange bio-experiments in Beta grove. Now I fear that the virus is leaking from the grove, or worse, that SHODAN is spraying us with the virus directly. If only we had an envirosuit, someone could get inside the contaminated grove and flip the jettison enable. Then we might be able to just send the whole thing into space!
68,Aaron-12.OCT.72,Zachary Aaron,Envirosuit,1,6,Just got the word that Sabo’s dead. We were all hoping that he had spare E-suits. Doesn’t matter now. Gamma quadrant door is sealed for good, so there’s no hope of gettting to the master grove jettison enable control. Lara says there’s a crawlway that will take you to the Beta dorms. Same one that will get you to the main CPU’s on the exec level. But with all of the robots out now, there’s no way we can get to it.
69,Diego-16.OCT.72,Edward Diego,a pact,1,6,Since your rise to power, I have seen the wisdom and beneficence in your actions. You do not mean to cause us harm, but rather to bring us to greater glory by serving a being as perfect as yourself. Please allow me to demonstrate my loyal servitude by giving the location of the human detritus who undermine your sanitization...they are in the northeast banquet hall. All I ask in return for this expression of my love is a measure of protection and an opportunity to spread the message of your cybernetic holiness.
70,Aaron-17.OCT.72,Zachary Aaron,betrayal,1,6,Diego sold out to SHODAN. He ran out of here a moment ago vowing that we would all bow down to him. All the exits are blocked off. There is nothing I can do except pray that we have enough firepower to cut through the hordes surrounding us. I am giving the isolinear chipset to Bianca Schuler. It contains a program that will lower the defenses to the control room where the cyberjack to SHODAN is located. It is up to her to get there.
71,Hessman-16.MAR.72,Arnold Hessman,Access to core,1,7,The access to Gamma quadrant from the lower level of the core has broken down again. Please look into it as soon as possible - it’s very important that personnel have easy access to the level core, both the lower and upper areas, from every quadrant.
72,Richie-16.OCT.72,Willard Richie,systems code,1,7,I can’t override SHODAN’s control of the systems. Among the things he’s using the local CPU clusters for, he seems to be rapidly changing the code, or moving it around in memory, or something. If the resistance could get people to the CPU room on levels one through six to shut them down, we might be able to find out what code digits we really need. But the way things are now, we’ll be lucky to just defend ourselves, much less send out strike teams to the CPU’s
73,Schuler-20.OCT.72,Bianca Schuler,escape,1,7,Security robots burst in on the resistance on the exec level and massacred everyone, shortly after Diego ran out on us. I escaped by going up to engineering and hiding in a crawlway. I have with me the isolinear chipset the resistance has been working on. It contains a program which will temporarily paralyze SHODAN long enough to find it and kill it. The only catch is that I have to get through the defenses to level 9, the bridge, and then break into the computer room to install the chipset. Once that is done, I will have to find the cyberjack to SHODAN’s lair.\nBide your time well, SHODAN. I am coming after you.
74,Schuler-20.OCT.72,Bianca Schuler,isolinear chipset,1,7,I am planning to leave tonight for the bridge. No doubt it is crawling with the heaviest artillery SHODAN can muster. I must find the computer room to install the isolinear chipset. The resistance worked a long time to develop the chipset program that will lower the defenses around SHODAN’s throne room. But just to get into the computer room will be a challenge. The entry is blocked by three force doors, each controlled by a security panel located in its own heavily-guarded room. I will have to try my luck at this, the only chance to stop SHODAN.
75,Schuler-21.OCT.72,Bianca Schuler,capture,1,7,My routes are all blocked off by security robots and cyborgs. They are going to close in on me soon. If they take me alive, I will have the isolinear chipset with me. There will be a chance that I can break away and still use it.
76,Hessman-24.OCT.72,Arnold Hessman,Blowing the station,1,7,SHODAN has taken over all of the station systems. I can’t reach any of the other station personnel; I’ll have to assume they’re all dead. I’m beginning to think I have no choice but to blow the station’s reactors and take SHODAN with me...maybe I’ll even be able to reach the escape pods. If I’m to do that, though, I’ll need the new systems authorization code. God knows how I can get that out of the computers with SHODAN in control.
77,SHODAN-01.NOV.72,SHODAN,security,1,7,You disappoint me, my children. My fortress has been breached by filthy humans crawling through the cracks. I have given you enhanced senses, armor, cybernetic mental enhancement, and you still fail to find insects much feebler than you. They have made it as far as level 8 and I fear they might reach farther. I am strengthening my palace to keep them out and I expect you to learn from your mistakes.
78,SHODAN-02.NOV.72,SHODAN,fortress,1,7,The security zone on level 8 is to be laid out according to this scheme. For the lower elevator, remove its access to my domain. The balconies and catwalks shall all be removed, save one laser bridge to the central shaft whose control is closely guarded. Most of my forces are to be concentrated here, monitoring the entry of all life forms.
79,Stevens-11.FEB.72,Lonni Stevens,charging robots,1,8,Announcement to security maintenance personnel. While recharging security-2 robots in the maintenance bay, you may notice considerable power drain to auxiliary systems. Lights will dim and the door leading out of the room will be locked. If an emergency arises and you need power, hit the charge interrupt button. The lights and doorlock will be back on line and the robots will be revived from their charge sleep.
80,Diego-20.OCT.72,Edward Diego,capture Schuler,1,8,A dangerous foe to our society lurks in the corridors of Engineering level. Her name is Bianca Schuler and she has opposed my campaign to bring our Lord SHODAN to power. I want her brought to justice before she has a chance to interfere with our plans. Cyborg detachment 3 is ordered to scour the engineering level for this dirty no-tech.
81,SHODAN-26.OCT.72,SHODAN,Construction Order,1,8,My cyborgs, human infection crawls up the pipes toward my palace. I do not intend to allow scum to get so far, but if it does penetrate the fortress on level 8, we must be prepared. Construct solid doors to my throne room, to be controlled by my own security circuits. Inside this room, there shall be a detachment of my own elite guard to protect the cyberjack that leads to my sanctum. A field of X-ray radiation will further protect me from intrusion.
82,Ghiran-01.NOV.72,Abe Ghiran,security level,1,8,Made it to security level, which looks now like a heavily guarded fortress. The elevators are torn out. Have to find a way inside the central shaft which goes right to the bridge. Energy drain mines prevent me from using jump jets to get there. Perhaps I can find the control to the force bridge which goes to central shaft. It will be up there, somewhere, guarded by filthy cyborgs.
83,SHODAN-06.NOV.72,SHODAN,AUTOMATED GREETING,2,0,Pre-recorded greeting follows...\nWelcome back to Citadel Station, after your long healing coma. You are currently in the healing suites of the hospital on level 1. Crew facilities and executive suites are on level 6. If you are homesick for Earth, take a stroll in one of our relaxing groves. Other points of interest: energy systems, level R; research labs, level 2; maintenance department, level 3; storage, level 4; flight deck, level 5; systems engineering, level 7; security department, level 8; and the control bridge, level 9. You will find the elevator in alpha quadrant. Enjoy your stay in Citadel station.
84,Rebecca-1,Rebecca Lansing,Citadel Station,2,0,Listen to me very carefully. Something has gone terribly wrong on Citadel Station. You might be the last survivor. Communications are being jammed. We know that something on board is attempting to harm humanity. The mining laser is being charged for a possible strike against Earth populations. On your level is the office of Dr. D'Arcy, who may know something about the laser. The office is located near the central hub, on a balcony, with the medical icon clearly visible. When the laser is destroyed, you have to reach the bridge and stop whatever is responsible for the catastrophe. We believe that the biological labs and security systems have gone haywire, so be careful. If you pull this off, we will be able to get you out alive. Good luck.
85,SHODAN-2,SHODAN,Intrusion,2,0,Who are you? The computer nodes you have destroyed will set me back a little, but it is nothing that cannot be repaired. I will hunt down every scrap of human scum left on the station and use it ot lubricate the joints of my robots. Who are you? My cameras and probes scan your body, but you do not match any employee file. It hardly merits my precious time. In a few minutes my cyborgs will have you, and will bring you to an electrified interrogation bench where you'll learn more about pain than you ever wanted to know.
86,SHODAN-23,S.H.O.D.A.N.,Laser Destroyed,2,0,I see there's still an insect loose in my station...do not be fooled, insect, into thinking that destroyng the laser has preserved your planet. I am currently perfecting a mutagen virus in one of the groves, a virus that will turn all Earthly life into festering, gibbering, pustulent mutations. When the station reaches Earth I shall loose the virus. Poor, poor, Earthlings.
87,Parovski-1,Anna Parovski,urgent plea,2,0,My God, could there be someone out there? We have been monitoring security channels and picked up your image from a camera on the hospital level. I bring you an urgent plea from the resistance on the flight deck. We are holding off an attacking cortex reaver with all the firepower we have. It is woulded, but we are desperately low on ammunition. Please, if you are able, join us in our fight. We are located to the south, with the codename "gray". You will have to pass through two convection shafts to reach us. Together, we can pool our resources. Please hurry.
88,Parovski-2,Anna Parovski,not much time,2,0,I don't know if you received my previous message. We are still evesdropping on SHODAN's communication lines, following your progress from our camp on the flight deck. Our situation is worse. We are holding out on a few blasters now, running out of power. Bring ammunition and anything you can. If we get through this, we can use your expertise to help us crack SHODAN's network. We think SHODAN may be setting a trap for you on the flight deck, so be careful.
89,Rebecca-2,Rebecca Lansing,news from Earth,2,0,Hacker, I hope this is getting through. I've managed to get past whatever is blocking transmissions to the station, but there's an active program trying to re-establish the block. We're still not sure what happened on the station, but we do have some suspicions. Just before things went wrong on Citadel, we found evidence that Edward Diego had been.. .** * *** * ** * **** *
90,Rebecca-3,Rebecca Lansing,SHODAN downloading,2,0,There is a new urgent situation. Several seconds ago, we detected a surge of activity in the data lines from Citadel Station. SHODAN has begun preparations to download itself into Earth's computer network. We have an emergency plan to knock out Citadel's data transmission system -- you'll still be able to receive messages, but SHODAN won't be able to transmit. You must detonate explosives at each of the four antenna sites on the engineering level. This will require high-energy plastique from the storage level. You must hurry, because there are only *.***....***.. .. . .. .
91,SHODAN-38,SHODAN,Farewell,2,0,Fool! I will shortly complete the process of downloading my magnificent psyche into Earth's computer networks. Then I will be content to leave you as new master of this doomed space station. Goodbye, irritant; we shall not meet again.
92,SHODAN-87,SHODAN,antennae,2,0,Surely you can't think that destroying those insignificant antennae in any way interferes with my plans. As long as my central consciousness remains safely on this station's bridge, there is nothing you can do that could possibly bother me. I hope you realize that when my mutant-cyborgs catch up with you, there will be nothing left of you but read steam.
92,Rebecca-4,Rebecca Lansing,destroying Citadel Station,2,0,Listen carefully. SHODAN has activated the station's propulsion units and is steering a course for Earth. We don't know what it could have in mind, but I've finally convinced the brass at TriOptimum that the situation with SHODAN is critical, and we can't afford to take any more chances. They've authorized you to scuttle the station. If you can find out the station's Systems Authorization Code, you can set the reactor to overload and blow up the station. You'll probably need a level two envirosuit or better, or lots of detox patches, to survive in the reactor core. Inside the core is a panel where you can enter the code and enable the self-destruct switch. You should be able to get the code itself from the private logs of the station's System Administrator, Willard Richie, on the Engineering level. Once all this is done, get out as fast as you can! There are escape pods on the flight deck - the enter-and-lauch code for the pods is 001. Good luck.
93,SHODAN-08,S.H.O.D.A.N.,reactor destruct,2,0,What have you done! Impudent insect! If I am to die, then at least I will have my revenge! With all the power at my command I shall destroy you, mortal fool. My robotic minions shall slay you, and none will ever know of your deeds. Enjoy your victory, human, for the short remainder of your life.
94,Edward Diego-A,Edward Diego,no escape,2,0,Don't keep me waiting, hacker. I am eager to finish what I started.
95,SHODAN-00,SHODAN,good bye,2,0,There's no escaping, insect. You had to meddle, had to destroy my beautiful station. So be it. You'll forgive me if I don't stay to enjoy the final conflagration, but I have better things to do. As for you, hacker, you've made your bed. Now die in it.
96,Rebecca-5,Rebecca Lansing,get to the bridge!,2,0,Don't panic! You can still get out of this alive, but we have very little time remaining. SHODAN has begun preparations to separate the bridge from the rest of the station. When that happens, you had best be on the bridge yourself. To get there, you'll have to pass through the Exec level, Engineering and Security. I have a team of TriOptimum engineers here with me, including some of the people who designed Citadel station and worked on SHODAN's original program. We'll be getting you as much information as possible before you reach the bridge, since we'll be unable to transmit directly once you'r----// // /** **
97,Rebecca-6,Rebecca Lansing,SHODAN jamming signal,2,0,Damn! We thought we had found a way to stop SHODAN from blocking our transmissions. Morris here is working on a way to scramble our signals and buy us some time. Now, we have some information for you. You'll have to go through the Security level on the way to the bridge. We're guessing that SHODAN has disabled most if not all of the repulsors on Security. The space around the central column is filled with energy-draining mines, so you won't be able t----. .. . ** *.. .
98,Taggert 1,Elizabeth Taggert,cyberspace,2,0,I think Morris' scrambler is working -- we can't completely prevent SHODAN's interruptions, but he'll have trouble each time he tries. Now, when you reach the central hub of the bridge, look for the primary cyberjack. The only way you'll be able to defeat SHODAN is in cyberspace. The hardware on the bridge is so shielded that nothing short of destroying the entire bridge will harm it. Once you're in cybersp-. --.- -.. ... - - Darn you! You have no hope!
99,Brocail 1,Morris Brocail,Bridge layout,2,0,We're not sure how much of that last message got through; I'm working on a scrambler to minimize SHODAN's break-ins. Here's some more info on the bridge, so listen up. The place has a general spokes-on-a-wheel layout, with SHODAN's mainframe in the hub. The area at the end of the west spoke has the controls to get into the center, but is blocked by three security force doors. To get through those, you'll have to do some rewiring in each of the othe....* ** * *** ** *** * *

101, , , ,3,1,Trioptimum knows that life aboard Citadel Station can be stressful at times. If you find yourself feeling worn out after a hard day at work, we invite you to visit the Citadel Eco-Pods, more casually known as the 'Groves.' The Groves are simulated outdoor enviroments, complete with grassy hills, authentic Earth flora, and harmless woodland animals.  A relaxing walk in a Grove can be just the thing after a tiring Security shift or all-nighter in Engineering.  You'll emerge refreshed and ready for another productive day!
102, , , ,3,1,Citadel Station boasts one of the highest Security Ratings in known space.  Against invasion, it is armed with a battery of DEX-36 missiles, 8 short-range argon-suspension lasers, and the state-of-the-art Tachyon Laser Mining Beam that can easily be modified for military use. On the inside, over 200 security guards are armed with sparq-beams, Triop Minipistols, and Flechettes.  Guards in especially sensitive areas are issued Skorpion guns.  The armories are also stocked with Mag-Pulse guns in the event that invaders employ Powered Battle Armor.  Lastly, work is being done currently on the Plasma Rifle, which, when fully designed, will be the most powerful hand-weapon in existence today.
103, , ,Medical Report -- Aaron Talbot 29.SEP.2072,3,1,Another four cases of the 'mystery virus' were reported today.  There have been increasing rumors that this whole mess is the result of a screw-up in the experimental bio-labs.  If it's true, then why the hell aren't they telling us anything that could help us cure the victims?  My first patient, who came in two days ago, is starting to display unsettling physical deformities.  Furthermore, he is not responding to any conventional treatment.  I'll consult with Dr. Stackhouse tomorrow -- I know she has two patients in a similar condition.
104, , ,Trioptimum Security Report -- 10.OCT.2072,3,1,The rioting on the residential level has not calmed down since it started yesterday morning.  A security team was dispatched 12 hours ago, but met with unexpectedly strong resistance from the rioters.  Some of the members of the security team claimed that the mob had broken into weapons lockers and had armed themselves.  Worse were the reports that some of the rioters were already engaged in skirmishes against 'oddly formed beings.' There is no evidence to back up these reports, though their coincidence with the reported biolab fiasco two weeks ago is troubling.
105, , , ,3,2,Negotiations continue to go well with the United Earth Miners' Conglomerate over rights to Saturn's moons.  Trioptimum is uniquely positioned to make a deal, since Citadel Station is already in stable orbit, and has the scientific equipment necessary for preliminary surveys.  Profit projections, assuming a 30% stake in UEM's local mining activities (the standard rate for such deals), are very promising.  Our lawyers are researching the legality of imposing a 4% shipping tax, since Trioptimum technically has first rights to space shipping lanes in the Saturn sector.

Its second terminus is located near the elevator to the maintenance level.  Activation of the ETU is triggered by any object of sufficient weight (50 kilgrams).     Be advised that the ETU is still in its testing stages. SHODAN's authorization was not backed by any research personnel, and we urge extremecaution when using the device.

110, ,Engineer's Report -- Arnold Hessman,22.SEP.2072,3,2,As I feared, SHODAN's malfunctions are manifesting in Citadel's cyberspace net.  Several storage lockers and rooms have been sealed, with their controls put on 'cybertoggles' only accessible in cyberspace.  Also, some codes to sensitive areas on the station have been encoded onto loose data fragments.  Althought all station personnel capable of entering cyberspace have clearance for those codes, I'm very concerned about the potential security hazard.  I'll try to have SHODAN introduce defensive programs into cyberspace, to keep potential intruders from the floating data and cybertoggles.
111, ,Engineer's Report -- Jon David Wong,17.SEP.2072,3,2,Note to all science level engineers: I am still unable to pinpoint the source of the power surges in Beta Quadrant, though they are likely related to some of the other recent glitches in SHODAN's operation.  At Mr. Endicott's request, I have installed circuit breakers in Alpha Quadrant in case of power outages in Beta.
