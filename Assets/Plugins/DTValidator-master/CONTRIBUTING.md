## Pull Request Process

1. Work in the `develop` branch which has the latest changes and also the unit tests.
2. Ensure the unit tests run and work correctly on your code.
3. If applicable, add units tests for the cases that your code is covering.
4. Open a pull request to merge your changes into `develop`.

Changes in `develop` will be merged to `master` after testing.
